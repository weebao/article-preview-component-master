## My process

- I have been wanting to learn SCSS so I looked up different features of SCSS before starting.
- I started with adding all the HTML components.
- I centered a rectangular div and adjust the box to look closer to the design.
- I finished with the SCSS, but I felt like I could have organized it better.
- I started working on the popping function, which was my first time applying JS to a website.
- The concept of the share button was simple enough so I finished with the JS and had it work nicely.

### Challenges

- First challenge was the share button. I created the circle by styling `<image>` directly but somehow the share icon was not centered. After a lot of panicking and adjusting with `translate`, I figured out an easy way out is to just put the image in a div and style the div.
- My second challenge was the JS part. It was my first time applying JS to a website so I had to look up and learn about DOM and eventListener. The idea of selecting element and editting the style in JS was quite straightforward but there were errors when I ran the website. So, I looked up and learned about how the content in DOM not being loaded before the JS and also about useful functions like async and defer, which helped nicely.
